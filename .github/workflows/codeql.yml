# Analyze your code with CodeQL for security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
#
# IMPORTANT: Code scanning must be enabled in repository settings for results to upload.
#
# To enable code scanning:
#   1. Go to your repository on GitHub (https://github.com/bryce-seefieldt/portfolio-docs)
#   2. Click the "Settings" tab
#   3. In the left sidebar, click "Code security and analysis"
#   4. Find "Code scanning" section
#   5. Click "Set up code scanning"
#   6. Select "CodeQL analysis" as the scanning tool
#   7. Review the default CodeQL workflow (or keep it as-is)
#   8. Click "Enable CodeQL"
#
# Once enabled, CodeQL results will appear in the "Security" tab under "Code scanning alerts"
# and this workflow will automatically upload analysis results.
