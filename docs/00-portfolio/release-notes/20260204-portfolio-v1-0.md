# Summary

Portfolio v1.0 is ready. Phase 5 professionalization is complete with reviewer-first navigation, evidence validation artifacts, and explicit known limitations.

# Highlights

- Reviewer guide and evidence checklist provide a fast validation path
- Narrative and project summaries refined for scanability
- Final known limitations documented for public-safe scope

# Added

- Reviewer guide: [/docs/00-portfolio/reviewer-guide.md](/docs/00-portfolio/reviewer-guide.md)
- Evidence audit checklist: [/docs/70-reference/evidence-audit-checklist.md](/docs/70-reference/evidence-audit-checklist.md)
- Known limitations: [/docs/00-portfolio/known-limitations.md](/docs/00-portfolio/known-limitations.md)

# Changed

- Docs entry paths updated for reviewer-first navigation
- Portfolio App narrative and project summaries refined
- 404 experience now links directly to the reviewer guide

# Governance and security baselines

- Public-safe constraints reaffirmed (no secrets, no sensitive endpoints)
- Evidence-first validation enforced via checklist

# Verification

- `pnpm verify` (docs) passes locally
- `pnpm verify` (app) passes locally with warnings:
  - build time above warning threshold (14.0s vs 4.2s)
  - `.next` JavaScript bundle scan reported no JS files found
- Cross-links verified for reviewer path artifacts

# Known limitations

- No authentication or backend contact form
- CMS integration and advanced analytics remain deferred

# Follow-ups

- Monitor build time warnings and validate bundle scan output
- Re-run full verification before any post-v1.0 changes
