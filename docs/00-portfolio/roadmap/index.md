## Purpose

This roadmap defines the **Portfolio Program** execution plan, centered on a high-grade **Portfolio App** (Next.js + TypeScript) and supported by the **Portfolio Documentation App** (Docusaurus) as the enterprise evidence engine.

It is written to:

- provide a realistic, staged delivery plan that produces reviewer-visible value early
- enforce an enterprise SDLC posture (docs-as-code, CI gates, traceability)
- define what artifacts must exist at each phase (dossiers, ADRs, threat models, runbooks, release notes)
- guide ongoing planning and implementation through a repeatable workflow

## Scope

### In scope

- Portfolio App product roadmap (features, IA, and UX)
- Documentation/Evidence roadmap (dossiers and enterprise artifacts)
- CI/CD and release governance roadmap
- Security and operational maturity roadmap

### Out of scope

- staffing models, budgets, or vendor procurement
- authentication and backend-heavy services (explicitly deferred early)

## Guiding principles

1. **Evidence-first delivery**
   - Every meaningful capability must have accompanying evidence artifacts (docs + governance).
2. **Small, high-quality increments**
   - Avoid broad refactors and large coupled changes.
3. **No broken links / no stale docs**
   - Builds fail on broken integrity conditions; fixes are required.
4. **Public-safe by design**
   - No secrets, internal endpoints, or sensitive operational detail leakage.
5. **Git is the system of record**
   - Release, rollback, and recovery center on traceable Git history and PR discipline.

## Program components

### A) Portfolio App (front-of-house)

A TypeScript-based web application that serves as:

- interactive CV
- curated project showcase
- entry point into enterprise evidence (links into docs app)

### B) Portfolio Documentation App (evidence engine)

A Docusaurus documentation platform that hosts:

- project dossiers
- ADRs
- threat models
- runbooks
- postmortems (when needed)
- release notes and governance policies

## Planning workflow (how this roadmap is executed)

For each phase or milestone:

1. **Create/Update plan docs first**
   - roadmap updates (this doc)
   - dossier updates for affected project
2. **Record major decisions**
   - ADRs for durable architectural or governance changes
3. **Assess security impact**
   - update threat model(s) if trust boundaries or entry points change
4. **Update operations readiness**
   - runbooks updated for deploy/rollback/triage changes
5. **Implement**
   - code changes via PR with CI gates
6. **Release + evidence**
   - release notes + links to PRs and deployed preview evidence

### Phase 2 Recommended Controls (Hardening Enhancements)

Beyond baseline Phase 1, Phase 2 includes optional hardening controls that strengthen enterprise security posture:

#### Security Enhancements

1. **Secrets Scanning Gate (TruffleHog CI)**
   - Detect hardcoded secrets before merge
   - CI job: `secrets-scan` (required check)

- Local verification: lightweight pattern-based scan; optional pre-commit for TruffleHog
- Threat model alignment: Information Disclosure (T1) mitigation

2. **CI Permission Hardening (Least-Privilege)**
   - Replace global `permissions: contents: write` with job-specific permissions
   - Quality job: `contents: write`, `pull-requests: read` (Dependabot auto-format)
   - Build job: `contents: read` (read-only)
   - Threat model alignment: Tampering (T2), Elevation of Privilege (E1) mitigations

3. **Pre-commit Hooks (Local Secret Scanning)**
   - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: TruffleHog hook for local commits
   - Setup: `pre-commit install` (one-time)
   - Threat model alignment: Information Disclosure (T1) prevention

#### Operational Enhancements

4. **Secrets Incident Response Runbook**
   - New: `rbk-portfolio-secrets-incident.md`
   - 5-phase procedure: Triage → Contain → Investigate → Remediate → Validate
   - Severity levels: Critical (≤5 min), High (≤30 min), Medium (≤2 hrs)
   - Threat model alignment: Incident Response procedures

5. **STRIDE Compliance Report**
   - New: `portfolio-app-stride-compliance-report.md`
   - Executive summary of all 12 threat mitigations
   - Control evidence mapping to source code and runbooks
   - Phase 2 enhancements documented and verified

#### Evidence Artifacts

- **CI Workflow:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (secrets-scan job + scoped permissions)
- **Local Scanning:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (TruffleHog hook)
- **Package Script:** `package.json` (`secrets:scan` script)
- **Incident Response:** `rbk-portfolio-secrets-incident.md` (complete runbook)
- **Compliance Report:** `portfolio-app-stride-compliance-report.md` (audit)

#### Implementation Status

- ✅ All Phase 2 recommended controls implemented (as of 2026-01-19)
- ✅ CI workflow updated with secrets scanning gate
- ✅ Permissions hardened to least-privilege per job
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks configured for local scanning

## Phase 3 — Repeatable project publishing pipeline (scale without chaos)

### Objective

Make adding projects predictable, low-friction, and consistent with governance.

### Deliverables (Portfolio App)

- Stage 3.1: YAML-backed project registry with Zod validation, slug rules, URL validation, build-time script
- Stage 3.2: — EvidenceBlock + VerificationBadge + BadgeGroup components; project pages render standardized evidence badges/links ([PR #28](https://github.com/bryce-seefieldt/portfolio-app/pull/28), [Docs PR #47](https://github.com/bryce-seefieldt/portfolio-docs/pull/47))
- Stage 3.3: Unit tests (Vitest) for registry/schema/slug helpers; Playwright e2e for route and evidence link resolution; wired into CI
- Stage 3.4: ADR-0011 (registry decision) and ADR-0012 (cross-repo linking); dossier updates; registry schema guide; Copilot instructions updated
- Stage 3.5: CI link validation (registry + evidence URLs), publish runbook, troubleshooting guide
- Stage 3.6: ✅ **Complete (2026-01-23)** Metadata + analytics (OG/Twitter cards, optional privacy-safe analytics) documented and implemented
  - [App PR # 36](https://github.com/bryce-seefieldt/portfolio-app/pull/36)
  - [Docs PR #55](https://github.com/bryce-seefieldt/portfolio-docs/pull/55)

### Required evidence artifacts (Docs App)

### Required evidence artifacts (Docs App)

- Update Portfolio App threat model with new controls and residual risks
- Add runbooks for:
  - dependency vulnerability response
  - suspected sensitive publication incident response (if not already)
- Postmortem process exercised if an incident occurs
- ADR(s) for major hardening changes that affect architecture or governance

### Acceptance criteria

- Demonstrable controls beyond basics:
  - scanning
  - audited release process
  - mature incident handling documentation
- Operational readiness is credible and not aspirational

---

## Phase 5 — Advanced demonstrations and multi-language portfolio expansion

### Objective

Show depth and breadth across languages and disciplines while maintaining enterprise consistency, and ensure the portfolio is reviewer-ready under time pressure.

### Deliverables

- Multiple projects across domains:
  - Python (automation, data, AI engineering, or platform tooling)
  - Java/C++ (systems or performance projects)
  - DevOps/SRE demonstrations (GitOps, DR/BCP, IaC, policy as code)
- Each project adheres to the same evidence standard:
  - dossier + ADR(s) + threat model (when relevant) + runbooks (when deployed)
- Portfolio App enhances discovery:
  - filtering/sorting projects by capability and proof type
  - “verification-first” display patterns

### Implementation focus (Phase 5 planning)

- **Narrative & information architecture refinement**
  - Portfolio App: sharpen homepage narrative, project summaries, and senior-level decision callouts
  - Docs App: improve navigation clarity, index hubs, and “start here” flows
- **Evidence validation & cross-checking**
  - Audit every major claim for linked evidence
  - Remove speculative language and undocumented assumptions
  - Add reviewer guide + evidence checklist
- **Production hardening pass**
  - Improve error handling UX and graceful degradation
  - Verify build reproducibility and environment safety
  - Update runbooks/ADRs to reflect final state
- **External signals of professionalism**
  - Consistent naming, clean commit history, README entry points
  - License clarity and contribution notes
- **Final review & freeze**
  - Feature freeze + documentation freeze
  - Tag release v1.0 with release notes and known limitations

### Required evidence artifacts

- Project dossiers per project
- ADRs for significant cross-cutting platform decisions
- Security/ops artifacts scaled appropriately to each project
- Evidence audit checklist
- Reviewer guide (“How to review this portfolio”)

### Acceptance criteria

- The portfolio reads like a cohesive program, not a collection of unrelated demos.
- Evidence remains current and traceable across the entire system.
- Reviewers can validate claims quickly with a clear reviewer path.
- Final release tagged with known limitations documented.

### Implementation guide

- See [Phase 5 Implementation Guide](phase-5-implementation-guide.md) for detailed steps, checklists, and success criteria.

---

## Phase 6 — Capstone, evolution, and long-term signal (optional)

### Objective

Preserve credibility over time by defining what belongs, how change is governed, and how the portfolio evolves without noise.

### Deliverables

- Portfolio inclusion criteria and explicit exclusions ("what does not belong")
- Portfolio versioning strategy (release cadence, tags, change log expectations)
- Deprecation and archival policy for projects, docs, and references
- Change intake workflow (proposal, evidence audit, reviewer impact)
- Maintenance posture guidance (stability window, update thresholds)

### Implementation focus

- **Restraint and judgment**
  - Keep the surface area stable and reduce churn-driven risk.
- **Governed evolution**
  - Add work only when it strengthens credibility and evidence depth.
- **Reviewer confidence**
  - Make the rules and lifecycle of the portfolio explicit and easy to validate.

### Required evidence artifacts

- ADR documenting portfolio lifecycle/versioning strategy
- Policy docs covering inclusion criteria and deprecation/archival expectations
- Runbook updates for archival/change control procedures
- Release note entry documenting Phase 6 completion

### Acceptance criteria

- New projects are gated by a published inclusion checklist and evidence criteria.
- Versioning and deprecation policies are documented and linked from core hubs.
- Reviewers can understand how the portfolio evolves without losing trust.

### Implementation guide

- See [Phase 6 Implementation Guide](phase-6-implementation-guide.md) for detailed steps, checklists, and success criteria.

## Backlog (candidate enhancements)

These are explicitly not required to reach “enterprise credible,” but can be added when justified by value and governed by ADR:

- contact form (adds abuse surface → requires threat model update + runbooks)
- authentication (deferred; high governance overhead)
- content CMS integration (requires careful boundary and supply chain analysis)
- analytics instrumentation (must remain privacy-respecting and public-safe)
- automated link checking between Portfolio App and Docs App (optional gate)

---

## Governance: Definition of Done for roadmap milestones

A milestone is complete only when:

- Code is deployed and accessible in production
- CI checks are green and required checks are enforced
- Documentation updates are complete:
  - dossier updated
  - ADR(s) created/updated for durable decisions
  - threat model updated if surface changes
  - runbooks updated if operational procedures change
- Release notes entry exists for material changes
- Public-safety requirements are satisfied (“No secrets added”)
