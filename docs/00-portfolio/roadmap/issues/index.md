## Overview

This hub collects all roadmap issue documents that drive planning and execution for each Phase/Stage. Issues here provide a durable, reviewer-friendly record that complements GitHub Issues and PRs.

Use this index to find the canonical task descriptions, acceptance criteria, and cross-links for current and past stages.

## Current Issues

## Completed Issues

## Authoring Conventions

- Front matter required: title, description, tags.
- Title format: `Stage X.Y — <scope>` with `(App)` or `(Docs)` when useful.
- Keep descriptions concise and action-oriented; add tags for phase/stage/app-or-docs.
- Cross-link the companion issue (App ↔ Docs) and the Phase Implementation Guide.

## Workflow

1. Draft the issue page here first (planning before implementation).
2. Open a feature branch and PR; link the companion issue and relevant docs.
3. On completion, update acceptance criteria and link the merged PR(s).
