## Purpose

This section provides the **high-signal portfolio narrative**: what the portfolio is, what it proves, and how a reviewer should explore the evidence. It is intentionally written to be legible for both technical and non-technical audiences.

This is the “front door” to the documentation program.

## Scope

### In scope

- product brief / “why this exists”
- capability map: a mapping of features and artifacts to demonstrable skills
- roadmap: planned work presented as deliverable increments
- release notes: what changed, why it matters, and how to validate
- reviewer guidance: how to evaluate the portfolio and linked projects

### Out of scope

- implementation detail (belongs in architecture/engineering/devops/security/ops)
- raw technical “notes” without context or a narrative purpose

## Audience

- primary: recruiters, hiring managers, cross-functional stakeholders
- secondary: engineers who want a guided path to technical depth

## What belongs here

Use this section to:

- provide an executive summary of the portfolio web app and the demo ecosystem
- explain how the documentation is organized and why it signals maturity
- highlight proof points with references to deeper sections (without duplicating them)

## Standard page shape for this section

Every page in `00-portfolio/` should include:

1. Purpose and intended reader
2. What the reader should learn / evaluate
3. Summary of evidence artifacts (by section name + file path reference)
4. Next steps (where to go deeper)

## Required artifacts to create early

Recommended initial files (create these first):

- `product-brief.md` — one-page narrative of the product and its differentiators
- `capabilities-map.md` — “proof matrix” mapping skills → artifacts → evidence
- `roadmap.md` — a living plan for delivery increments and maturity milestones
- `phase-1-completion-checklist.md` — master checklist for Phase 1 final validation (admin tasks)
- `release-notes/` — versioned release notes (e.g., v0.1.0, v0.2.0)

## Current Status (Phase 3)

- Phase 1: ✅ Complete (portfolio-app foundation with CI, Vercel previews, dossier + ADRs + runbooks)
- Phase 2: ✅ Complete (gold standard exemplar, Playwright smoke tests in CI, STRIDE compliance, secrets scanning gate)
- Phase 3: 🟡 In progress — Stage 3.1 (registry + validation) complete; Stage 3.2 (EvidenceBlock/Badges) in flight

Navigation to active artifacts:

- Roadmap hub: [roadmap/index.md](./roadmap/index.md)
- Implementation guides: [roadmap/phase-1-implementation-guide.md](./roadmap/phase-1-implementation-guide.md), [roadmap/phase-2-implementation-guide.md](./roadmap/phase-2-implementation-guide.md), [roadmap/phase-3-implementation-guide.md](./roadmap/phase-3-implementation-guide.md)
- Stage issues: [roadmap/issues/index.md](./roadmap/issues/index.md) (Stage 3.1 and 3.2 app/docs issues)
- Release notes: [release-notes/index.md](./release-notes/index.md) (Phase 1 and Phase 2 milestones)

## Portfolio writing guidelines (strict)

- Write for clarity and credibility; avoid buzzwords without evidence.
- Prefer bullet points over long paragraphs.
- Make claims only when there is documentation evidence elsewhere.
- Use consistent language:
  - “portfolio web app” = the primary product
  - “demo projects” = supporting exemplars
  - “evidence artifacts” = ADRs, runbooks, threat models, pipeline checks

## Validation and quality expectations

A portfolio narrative page is “good” when:

- a reviewer can understand the scope in < 2 minutes
- it links (conceptually) to the correct domain sections for verification
- it does not contain implementation detail that belongs elsewhere

## Failure modes and troubleshooting

Common problems:

- **Overloaded narrative:** too much technical detail → move it to the correct domain and summarize here.
- **Unverifiable claims:** statements not backed by artifacts → add a capability map entry and create the missing artifact.
- **Timeline drift:** roadmap not matching actual releases → update roadmap and release notes in the same PR.

## References

Operational rule: any change that impacts product claims must also update:

- capability map and/or roadmap and/or release notes
