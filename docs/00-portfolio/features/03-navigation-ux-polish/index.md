## Purpose

Define how navigation and UX polish features are documented and validated.

## Scope

### In scope

- navigation behavior and menus
- animation and motion affordances
- layout components that influence usability

### Out of scope

- theming details (see theming group)

## Prereqs / Inputs

- UX standards and accessibility expectations exist

## Procedure / Content

- Use the standard feature page fields and provide manual validation steps.

### Governance focus

- navigation must be consistent across breakpoints and always reachable
- motion and transitions must respect reduced-motion preferences
- UI affordances should signal where evidence is discoverable

## Validation / Expected outcomes

- Navigation is predictable and accessible.

## Failure modes / Troubleshooting

- Navigation dead-ends or missing paths: update links and re-test.
