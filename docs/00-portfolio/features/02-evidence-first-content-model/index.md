## Purpose

Define how evidence-first content features are documented and validated.

## Scope

### In scope

- project registry features
- evidence linking and evidence visualization components

### Out of scope

- CI/CD or security controls (see other groups)

## Prereqs / Inputs

- Registry schema and validation docs exist

## Procedure / Content

- Use the standard feature page fields and link to evidence sources.

### Governance focus

- registry schema changes must include validation updates and examples
- evidence links should be complete for gold-standard projects
- badge and evidence grids must not render empty states without context

## Validation / Expected outcomes

- Evidence links are accurate and verifiable.

## Failure modes / Troubleshooting

- Broken links or missing evidence: update registry and revalidate.
