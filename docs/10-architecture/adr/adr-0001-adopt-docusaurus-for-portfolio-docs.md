## Purpose

Record the decision to use **Docusaurus** as the documentation platform for the portfolio program, including tradeoffs, consequences, and validation criteria.

## Scope

### Use when
- establishing the baseline documentation platform for the portfolio program
- selecting a documentation tool that supports enterprise navigation, governance, and CI gates

### Do not use when
- selecting minor plugins or small presentation tweaks (unless they materially change the platform posture)

## Prereqs / Inputs

- Decision owner(s): Portfolio maintainer
- Date: 2026-01-06
- Status: Accepted
- Related work items: N/A (initial platform decision)
- Related risks:
  - supply chain and dependency risk inherent to Node-based toolchains
  - risk of publishing sensitive information
  - risk of navigation/IA drift as docs scale

## Decision Record

### Title
ADR-0001: Adopt Docusaurus for Portfolio Documentation

### Context

The portfolio program requires a documentation system that is:

- Markdown-first and author-friendly in VS Code (WSL2)
- version-controlled and PR-governed (docs-as-code)
- scalable to an enterprise-style information architecture
- able to enforce quality gates (build fails on broken links)
- deployable publicly with a professional UI/UX suitable for portfolio reviewers
- capable of hosting technical diagrams and structured, navigable documentation

### Decision

Adopt **Docusaurus (TypeScript)** as the documentation platform, using:

- filesystem-driven docs under `docs/`
- autogenerated sidebar strategy governed by `_category_.json`
- `pnpm` as the package manager
- CI quality gate requiring `pnpm build` to pass before merge

### Alternatives considered

1. **MkDocs + Material**
   - Pros:
     - fast, stable, simple static site pipeline
     - excellent theme and search ecosystem
   - Cons:
     - less aligned with modern JS/TS portfolio narrative (if you want interactive documentation patterns)
     - customization and “app-like” UX patterns may require more work
   - Why not chosen:
     - Docusaurus better fits a portfolio program where documentation is part of a modern web engineering story.

2. **Obsidian + Quartz**
   - Pros:
     - exceptional local authoring experience (linking/graph)
     - good for rapid ideation and personal knowledge management
   - Cons:
     - governance and structured enterprise navigation requires additional conventions/tooling
     - can drift toward personal note-taking rather than polished product documentation
   - Why not chosen:
     - this repository prioritizes enterprise-grade public documentation over a personal PKM-first workflow.

3. **Custom Next.js docs**
   - Pros:
     - maximum control; consistent with full-stack portfolio stack
   - Cons:
     - higher maintenance and greater risk of “building the platform instead of the content”
     - requires re-implementing many doc-native features (sidebars, versioning patterns, doc search)
   - Why not chosen:
     - Docusaurus provides a strong baseline with less platform engineering overhead.

### Consequences

- Positive consequences:
  - Strong, industry-recognizable docs-as-code platform
  - Scales to large doc sets with predictable navigation and category governance
  - Professional “product docs” presentation suitable for external reviewers
  - Tight integration with CI gates (`pnpm build`)

- Negative consequences / tradeoffs:
  - Node dependency surface introduces supply chain considerations
  - Requires discipline to avoid overusing MDX and turning docs into “app code”
  - Requires consistent IA governance to prevent nav drift

- Operational impact:
  - Docs site becomes a deployable artifact; requires deploy/rollback runbooks
  - Build failures (links, structure) block merges and must be triaged quickly

- Security impact:
  - Must enforce strict “no secrets” publication rules
  - Must manage dependency updates and CI integrity as first-class concerns

- Cost/complexity impact:
  - Moderate complexity relative to MkDocs, but justified by capability and portfolio alignment

### Implementation notes (high-level)

- Scaffold Docusaurus with TypeScript and pnpm.
- Implement:
  - `docs/index.md` as the landing entrypoint
  - top-level domain folders (`00-…70-…`) each with `_category_.json` + `index.md`
  - internal-only scaffolding under `docs/_meta/` (underscore-prefixed, not public)
- Add CI:
  - must run `pnpm build` and fail on broken links.

## Validation / Expected outcomes

- Local validation:
  - `pnpm start` renders site with coherent sidebar
  - `pnpm build` succeeds deterministically
- Governance validation:
  - PR-only merges; build gate enforced
  - adding a new folder + `_category_.json` reliably produces coherent navigation
- Reviewer validation:
  - “Start here” path is obvious and leads to domain and project dossiers

## Failure modes / Troubleshooting

- Build instability due to dependency drift:
  - mitigation: pinned toolchain expectations; lockfile discipline; review dependency changes
- Navigation entropy:
  - mitigation: enforce `_category_.json` + index hubs; consistent positions and naming
- Accidental sensitive publication:
  - mitigation: strict policy + scanning + incident response procedure
