## Dossier Contents

- [Overview](01-overview.md)
- [Architecture](02-architecture.md)
- [Deployment](03-deployment.md)
- [Security](04-security.md)
- [Testing](05-testing.md)
- [Operations](06-operations.md)
- [Troubleshooting](07-troubleshooting.md)

## Purpose

This dossier documents the **Portfolio Docs App**: a Docusaurus-based, docs-as-code platform that serves as the portfolio program’s public-facing documentation system.

The Portfolio Docs App is treated as a production-like service to demonstrate:

- enterprise documentation information architecture and governance
- documentation-as-code delivery discipline (PRs, CI, quality gates)
- security posture appropriate for a public site (supply chain, secrets hygiene, build integrity)
- operational readiness (deploy/rollback/runbooks, maintenance, recovery assumptions)

This dossier is intentionally written as a **microcosm** of how the larger portfolio web app and demo ecosystem will be documented.

## Scope

### In scope

- what the Portfolio Docs App is and what it proves
- architecture and content domain model
- deployment model and pipeline contract
- security posture (threat surface + enforceable SDLC controls)
- “testing” for docs: build/link integrity/lint/format
- operations: runbooks, maintenance cadence, recovery expectations
- troubleshooting for common Docusaurus/docs-as-code failure modes

### Out of scope

- full portfolio web app product documentation (documented as its own dossier later)
- detailed hosting vendor-specific secrets or account configuration
- any internal-only authoring scaffolding stored under `docs/_meta/` (non-public)

## Prereqs / Inputs

- Repository baseline:
  - Docusaurus (TypeScript) project using pnpm
  - filesystem-driven docs under `docs/`
  - autogenerated sidebar strategy (recommended)
- Working environment:
  - Windows 11 + WSL2 (Ubuntu) + VS Code Remote-WSL
- Governance baseline:
  - PR-only merges to `main`
  - docs build must succeed (`pnpm build`) prior to merge
  - publication safety rules enforced (no secrets, no internal endpoints)

## Procedure / Content

### Dossier structure (this folder)

This dossier is organized as a set of reviewer-navigable pages:

- `overview.md` — product framing, goals, NFRs, and evidence map
- `architecture.md` — system design and content domain model
- `deployment.md` — CI/CD contract, environments, hosting, release discipline
- `security.md` — threat surface, SDLC controls, supply chain posture
- `testing.md` — quality gates for docs (build/link/lint/format)
- `operations.md` — runbooks, maintenance, DR assumptions, ownership
- `troubleshooting.md` — common problems + deterministic fixes

### Where supporting enterprise artifacts live

This dossier references and depends on domain-level artifacts:

- ADRs: `docs/10-architecture/adr/`
- Threat models: `docs/40-security/threat-models/`
- Runbooks: `docs/50-operations/runbooks/`
- Pipeline and platform docs: `docs/30-devops-platform/`
- Style and taxonomy (internal-only): `docs/_meta/`

## Validation / Expected outcomes

This dossier is considered “complete enough for first publication” when:

- the dossier pages exist and follow the standard page shape
- the docs site builds successfully (`pnpm build`)
- navigation is coherent:
  - category metadata exists at `docs/60-projects/portfolio-docs-app/_category_.json`
  - this hub page is the category landing page
- claims in these pages map to concrete governance/pipeline/security/ops artifacts (even if some artifacts are initially stubbed)

## Current State

- ✅ **Docs infrastructure**: Docusaurus + TypeScript configured for enterprise authoring patterns
- ✅ **Architecture and governance**: 7-page dossier with full threat model, security analysis, and operational baseline
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline**: Quality gates (lint, format check, link validation); build determinism enforced with frozen lockfiles; branch protection via required checks
- ✅ **Security hardening plan**: ADR-0019 and the docs hardening implementation plan published; audit gates and header validation tracked via the security program
- ✅ **Testing and validation**: Complete build/link/lint/format quality gates; local `pnpm verify` script with 8-step workflow
- ✅ **Operational procedures**: Comprehensive runbooks and governance documentation in `docs/50-operations/runbooks/`
  - **Project Publish Runbook**: 6-step, time-boxed procedure (3 hours) for portfolio app project publication
    - Covers Planning → Registry Entry → Dossier Update → Link Validation → PR/Review → Post-Publish
    - Validation signals: `pnpm registry:validate`, `pnpm links:check`, `pnpm build`
    - Includes rollback and abort procedures
  - **Troubleshooting Guide**: 5 common project-publication failure modes with diagnostic steps
    - Covers invalid slugs, broken dossier links, missing evidence URLs, schema validation failures, CI link-validation flakiness
    - References playwright-report artifacts from CI for debugging

## Failure modes / Troubleshooting

- Dossier pages drift into general policy (belongs in domain sections) → refactor content into the appropriate domain and keep dossier as project-specific summary.
- The dossier becomes marketing-only → add validation procedures and operational/security evidence.
- The dossier references artifacts that do not exist yet → remove links, add path references, and create the missing artifacts via tracked work.
