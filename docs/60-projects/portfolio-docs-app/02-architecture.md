## Purpose

This page describes the Portfolio Docs App architecture at a practical level:

- how content is structured and routed
- how navigation is generated and governed
- what components exist (content, configuration, deployment surface)
- how the architecture supports enterprise documentation outcomes

## Scope

### In scope
- content domain model and folder structure
- navigation generation strategy (autogenerated sidebars + category metadata)
- “public docs” vs “internal scaffolding” separation (`docs/_meta`)
- diagram conventions and documentation lifecycle rules

### Out of scope
- pipeline implementation details (see `deployment.md`)
- threat enumeration and controls (see `security.md`)

## Prereqs / Inputs

- A Docusaurus site with docs stored under `docs/`
- An established top-level domain scaffold:
  - `00-portfolio` / `10-architecture` / `20-engineering` / `30-devops-platform`
  - `40-security` / `50-operations` / `60-projects` / `70-reference`
- Internal authoring scaffolding stored in `docs/_meta/`

## Procedure / Content

## System boundaries and components

### Core components
- **Docs content** (`docs/`):
  - all public-facing documentation content
  - organized by enterprise domains and project dossiers

- **Navigation governance**:
  - `sidebars.ts` uses `autogenerated` based on filesystem
  - `_category_.json` inside navigable folders defines label, ordering, and landing behavior
  - top-level domains link to curated `index.md` hub pages

- **Site configuration**:
  - `docusaurus.config.ts` defines global site settings and docs plugin behavior
  - (optional) Mermaid enablement for diagrams, if adopted

- **Static assets** (`static/`):
  - images and diagrams, stored with stable names
  - optional evidence artifacts in sanitized form (if later added)

### Internal-only authoring scaffolding
- `docs/_meta/` is intentionally not public-facing.
- It contains templates, style guides, taxonomy rules, and contributor instructions that should not clutter the public site.
- Governance narrative (if desired publicly later) should be copied into a dedicated public section rather than renaming `_meta`.

## Content domain model (enterprise scaffold)

Top-level domains are designed to map to enterprise responsibilities:

- `00-portfolio`: narrative + roadmap + releases (human legibility)
- `10-architecture`: system design + ADR traceability (technical intent)
- `20-engineering`: build/test standards + local dev reproducibility
- `30-devops-platform`: CI/CD + environments + observability
- `40-security`: threat models + SDLC controls + supply chain posture
- `50-operations`: runbooks + IR + DR/BCP readiness
- `60-projects`: per-project dossiers (this section)
- `70-reference`: fast-access command and config references

This scaffold is designed to scale without becoming a “notes dump.”

## Navigation and discoverability strategy

### Autogenerated sidebars
- The sidebar should be filesystem-driven, so new content appears without manual sidebar maintenance.
- Governance is applied via:
  - consistent folder and file naming
  - `_category_.json` metadata for every navigable folder
  - consistent `index.md` hub pages for major sections

### Category landing behavior
- Top-level domains use:
  - `_category_.json` → `link.type: doc` pointing to `<domain>/index.md`
- Subsections default to:
  - `_category_.json` → `link.type: generated-index` until a curated hub is justified

This is the maintainability and reviewer-experience balance.

## Diagram and visual conventions (recommended)
- Use diagrams only when they reduce ambiguity.
- Keep diagrams minimal (avoid “mega diagrams”).
- Prefer Mermaid for flows/sequence diagrams (if enabled).
- Store images under `static/img/diagrams/` with stable filenames.

## Documentation lifecycle (prevent drift)
- “Docs follow changes” rule:
  - if the structure or governance changes, update the affected indexes and `_category_.json` in the same PR
- “No orphan knowledge” rule:
  - every new folder must have a category definition and an entrypoint (generated or curated)

## Validation / Expected outcomes

Architecture is correct when:
- adding a new folder + `_category_.json` reliably produces coherent navigation
- top-level domains present curated entrypoints for reviewers
- internal templates remain non-public under `docs/_meta/`
- the system can scale to a large documentation corpus without sidebar churn

## Failure modes / Troubleshooting

- **Sidebar unpredictability:** ordering becomes confusing → enforce `position` in `_category_.json` and `sidebar_position` in key docs.
- **Category click leads nowhere:** category has no `link` → add a `doc` link to `index.md` or a generated-index link.
- **Meta docs leak publicly:** `_meta` renamed or moved → restore underscore prefix and keep internal-only scaffolding separated.
