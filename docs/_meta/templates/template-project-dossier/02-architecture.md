## Purpose

This page describes the architecture at a practical level:

- how content is structured and routed
- how navigation is generated and governed
- what components exist (content, configuration, deployment surface)
- how the architecture supports enterprise documentation outcomes

## Scope

### In scope

- content domain model and folder structure
- navigation generation strategy (autogenerated sidebars + category metadata)
- “public docs” vs “internal scaffolding” separation (`docs/_meta`)
- diagram conventions and documentation lifecycle rules

### Out of scope

- pipeline implementation details (see `deployment.md`)
- threat enumeration and controls (see `security.md`)

## Prereqs / Inputs

- A Docusaurus site with docs stored under `docs/`
- An established top-level domain scaffold:
  - `00-portfolio` / `10-architecture` / `20-engineering` / `30-devops-platform`
  - `40-security` / `50-operations` / `60-projects` / `70-reference`
- Internal authoring scaffolding stored in `docs/_meta/`

## Procedure / Content

## System boundaries and components

### Core components

### Internal-only authoring scaffolding

## Content domain model (enterprise scaffold)

Top-level domains are designed to map to enterprise responsibilities:

- `00-portfolio`: narrative + roadmap + releases (human legibility)
- `10-architecture`: system design + ADR traceability (technical intent)
- `20-engineering`: build/test standards + local dev reproducibility
- `30-devops-platform`: CI/CD + environments + observability
- `40-security`: threat models + SDLC controls + supply chain posture
- `50-operations`: runbooks + IR + DR/BCP readiness
- `60-projects`: per-project dossiers (this section)
- `70-reference`: fast-access command and config references

This scaffold is designed to scale without becoming a “notes dump.”
