# Configuration Details

## Baseline Config
1. Broken links == Hard Failures.
2. Production Hosting: Vercel via Git integration a (Preview Deployments for branches and a Production Deployment for production branch i.e. `main`).
3. Autogenerated Sidebars 
4. Use Categories ([`_categories_.json`](#_category_json))
5. [Mermaid Diagrams enabled]()

## `_category_.json`

### Key Policy

- Every folder that appears in the sidebar must have _category_.*.
- Top-level domains link to curated index.md docs (type: doc).
- Subfolders default to generated-index until you need custom narrative.
- Every category index (generated or curated) must have a clear Purpose + Scope + Next Steps.
- Use slug to keep public URLs clean (avoid numeric prefixes leaking into routes).

### Sidebar Appearance 

When you use an [autogenerated sidebar](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/sidebar/autogenerated), Docusaurus treats each folder as a “category” and each Markdown file as a doc link. 

Placing `_category_.json` or `_category_.yml` inside a folder lets you define category metadata, including ordering and labeling. Docusaurus explicitly documents that you can add `_category_.yml` and “specify any category metadata and also the position metadata.” 

That metadata includes (common fields):
- label (what users see in the sidebar)
- position (ordering within the autogenerated slice)
- collapsible / collapsed
- optional fields like className, key, customProps 

### Automatic Category “Landing Page” 

[Sidebar items](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/items)

A category can be clickable and route to a page. Docusaurus supports “category links,” and notes that autogenerated categories can use _category_.yml to declare that link
The most important option is:

```yml
link: { type: "generated-index", ... }
```
This tells Docusaurus to auto-generate an index page for the category that lists the category’s direct children. 

Docusaurus even recommends generated-index as a quick way to create an “introductory document.” 

This is extremely valuable for an enterprise-style docs repo: every major folder becomes a proper entry point, not just a collapsible menu.

### Formalized Ordering

Docusaurus supports ordering autogenerated sidebars using number prefixes (e.g. “00/10/20…” scaffold). 

Position provides another layer of control for ordering within a folder slice.

Note: Docusaurus clarifies that position only affects the items within that sidebar.


### Content Requirements

Each navigable folder should have:

- `label`: human-friendly title (hides numeric prefixes from users)
- `position`: ordering within that folder’s autogenerated listing
- `link`: either generated-index (bootstrap/default) or doc (for curated overviews)

Docusaurus shows a canonical `_category_.json` example including `position`, `label`, `collapsible/collapsed`, and `link: { type: "generated-index", title: ... }`.

### Recommended standard

**Pattern 1: Use generated-index for most subfolders**

This is the “low-friction, always works” approach.
```json
{
  "label": "CI/CD",
  "position": 2,
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index",
    "title": "CI/CD",
    "description": "Pipeline stages, quality gates, artifact strategy, environment promotion, and rollback procedures.",
    "slug": "/devops/ci-cd",
    "keywords": ["cicd", "github-actions", "deployment", "release"],
    "image": "/img/diagrams/c4/pipeline.png"
  }
}
```

**_Fields_**
- `title/description` makes the hub page read like a proper “section front door.” Docusaurus documents that generated-index supports title, description, slug, keywords, and image.
- `slug` prevents ugly URLs derived from filesystem naming (important when you use numeric prefixes).
- `keywords` helps site search/SEO.
- `image` gives your hubs a “product docs” feel via the card UI.

**Pattern 2: Use `doc` link for top-level sections with curated overview pages**

For a custom “executive summary” page (highly recommended for `00-portfolio`, `10-architecture`, `40-security`, `50-operations`), link the category to that doc instead of generated index.

Docusaurus supports category links to an existing doc (`type: 'doc', id: ...`). 

Also note: doc links can be resolved relatively within autogenerated categories, which makes maintenance easier. 

```json
{
  "label": "Security",
  "position": 40,
  "link": { "type": "doc", "id": "40-security/index" }
}
```

Now `docs/40-security/index.md` becomes the “Security front door” with:
- security objectives and assumptions
- threat model pointers
- SDLC controls checklist
- links to scan evidence
- and a structured list of subpages

**Tip:** For the nice generated “cards list” on that curated index page, you can embed `DocCardList` in the doc page itself. Docusaurus documents `DocCardList` for embedding the category card list inside a normal doc page

**Advanced: using `customProps` for maturity/ownership signals**

Docusaurus shows `customProps` in `_category_` metadata and notes it can be used if you customize (“swizzle”) the DocCard rendering. 

For enterprise-level polish, use `customProps` to record (and later render):
- `owner`: “Platform / DevOps”
- `maturity`: draft | beta | stable
- `lastReviewed`: YYYY-MM-DD

Provides “evidence dashboard” feel without inventing a separate system.
