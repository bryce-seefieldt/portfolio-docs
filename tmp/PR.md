# Summary

## What changed

- Removed milestone/phase references across docs and runbooks.
- Normalized labels in reference and implementation guidance.
- Archived roadmap issues into docs/_archive/closed-issues with release note.

## Why

- Keep documentation readable as a completed guide without milestone framing.

## Scope

- [x] Docs content update
- [x] New section/folder (_category_ + index hub)
- [ ] Templates / style guide
- [ ] CI/CD / workflows
- [ ] Security / threat model / SDLC controls
- [x] Operations / runbooks / IR / DR

## Evidence

- [ ] `ci / quality` passed (lint, typecheck, format)
- [ ] `ci / build` passed (Docusaurus build + broken links check)
- [ ] `codeql` checks passed
- [ ] Includes closing keyword for linked issue (e.g., Closes #123)
- Links / screenshots / notes: N/A

## Nav / Structure

- [x] New/updated folders include `_category_.json` or `_category_.yml`
- [x] New section has an index hub (generated-index or curated index doc)
- [ ] Sidebars/autogenerated navigation renders correctly

## Security

- [x] No secrets added (confirmed)
- [x] New/updated MDX reviewed as code (if applicable)
- [ ] Hosting header changes validated (if applicable)
- [ ] If security-relevant: threat model / controls updated or issue created
  - Link to update/issue:

## Quality checklist

- [x] Front matter included (title, description, tags; sidebar fields if needed)
- [ ] Uses standard page structure (Purpose / Scope / Procedure / Validation / Troubleshooting / Refs)
- [x] Commands are copy/paste safe and specify shell (`bash`/`powershell`)
- [x] Any destructive steps include rollback guidance

## Notes for reviewers (optional)

- Includes relocation of roadmap issue docs into docs/_archive/closed-issues and a release note entry.
